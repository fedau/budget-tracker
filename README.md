In this project I made a react app that allows me to track my budget and my spending. You can add different budget categories and give them a maximum amount of spending. You can add expenses into specific categories and a progress bar will tell you how close you are to reaching your limit.
There is also a total amount tracker and an Uncategorized section incase you delete your budgetcategory but not you spendings or if you have spendings that don't fit anywhere.

I used npm, react, javascript and react bootstrap
